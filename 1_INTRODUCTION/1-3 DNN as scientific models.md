Accounts of scientific understanding
What are the crucial conditions for understanding from a model?
The history and practice of science regularly shows that its theories and models are not true descriptions of reality. If we assume that we still understand something with (mostly) untrue models - what characteristics of a model enable us to do so, and of what kind of understanding do we mean?
- idealized, fictional models are untrue

De Regt: 
when you understand, you do not gain some type of knowledge, but rather you gain the skill to predict behavior of the target system.
understanding enables us to predict
intelligbility: what values do scientist attribute to the theoretical virtues of a model



model
target phenomenon
model-induced explanation
complex model


idealization
simulation
abstraction
similarity
explainability
intelligibility: as pragmatic value
contextuality: purpose-context, 
transparency
relation between prediction and understanding

biological inspiration as an argument for ML models
implementation
parameterization







what are generally accepted criteria that models need to enable understanding?
what are epistemic criteria? what are non-epistemic criteria to evaluate whether a model is accepted for scientific purposes or not?
