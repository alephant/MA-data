**The degree of structural opacity is a function of model complexity**
“The structural opacity of a large cosmology or climate simulation is an accidental function of size and accretion; a similar but smaller program would be easier to understand.” (Creel, 2020, p. 19) 

**Epistemic opacity is a context-dependent feature of computational science**
A cognitive agent is not able to know and understand all epistemically relevant elements of a computational process.
“Here a process is epistemically opaque relative to a cognitive agent X at time t just in case X does not know at t all of the epistemically relevant elements of the process.” (Humphreys, 2009, p. 618)
