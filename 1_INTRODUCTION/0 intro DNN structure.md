**Key differences between perceptrons and DNN**
“Contemporary deep neural networks, while stemming from their simpler ancestors, differ in at least four important ways, as summarized by Buckner (2019): they contain many more layers, increasing their efficiency; they are composed of heterogeneous processing units with different activation functions; they are sparsely connected; and they use more techniques to avoid overfitting. These added complexities increase both performance and opacity.” (Creel, 2020, p. 20)
