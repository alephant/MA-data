The history and practice of science regularly shows that its theories and models are not true descriptions of reality. If we assume that we still understand something with (mostly) untrue models - what characteristics of a model enable us to do so, and of what kind of understanding do we mean?
Explanatory understanding
Degrees of understanding


how-possibly explanations/ heuristics etc. do enable understanding:
- “Lipton (2009, pp. 49–52) presents interesting arguments for the thesis that potential (how-possibly) explanations can provide understanding” (Regt, 2015, p. 3789)
