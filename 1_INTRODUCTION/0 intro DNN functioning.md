**DNN use is driven by the assumption that true function f is in the set of all functions f representable**
“Deep learning is a machine learning technique based on artificial neural networks that is widely used for prediction and classification tasks. The goal of deep learning is to automate the search for a function ˆ f that approximates the true function f that generates observed data. The fundamental assumption that motivates the use of deep learning is that f is in the set of functions F representable by a neural network given some particular architecture and (hyper)parameterization. Of course, for any given parameterization k, we have no way of knowing a priori whether f is element of Fk. However, deep neural networks are universal approximators (Hornik et al. 1989), so the assumption is at least principled.” (Duede, 2023, p. 1091)
