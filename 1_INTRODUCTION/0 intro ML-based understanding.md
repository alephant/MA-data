What do DNN do to provide understanding?
What are case studies that illustrate when DNN provide understanding?
What does it mean when they provide understanding?
Are there reasons why it is better to say that DNN "improve" understanding?

**DNN used as guides to "improve" understanding and theory building**
“This case demonstrates the use of deep learning to dramatically improve our understanding of the geophysics of earthquakes ==by providing researchers good reasons== to consider integrating known geophysical properties into existing theory.” (Duede, 2023, p. 1096)

“In this case, a fully opaque DLM has profound implications for our theoretical understanding of earthquake dynamics. Namely, the ability to accurately predict phenomena orients scientific attention to empirical desiderata necessary for more accurate theory building.” (Duede, 2023, p. 1097)
