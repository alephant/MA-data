==Predictive success of DNN is relevant for DNN to provide understanding, but it is not necessarily indicative that DNN can in fact provide understanding.==

**The case of spurious correlations underlying prediction illustrates why predictive power is not necessarily indicative of explanatory power.**
“Spurious correlations are misleading about the causal relations underlying a prediction. If a model is based on spurious correlations, the model’s predictive accuracy may be bad for a relevant subset of data, namely the subset where the difference between mere correlation and causal relation makes an observable difference. Caruana et al. (2015) provide a notorious example of a model for hospital admission triage that is (at least to a large extent) predictively successful, but makes wrong and harmful predictions for a subset of cases. However, a model that is to a large extent predictively successful, but that may still be systematically wrong about a target system given the knowledge of the researchers, is not a good tool for yielding understanding about the target system.” (Räz and Beisbart, 2022, p. 14)

**High-level properties of DNN underlying their predictive success not well understood**
generalization: “However, the reasons why these DNNs generalize well is only insufficiently understood (Zhang et al., 2017; Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017; Alain & Bengio, 2016; Zhang et al., 2021; Berner et al., 2021).” (Räz and Beisbart, 2022, p. 13)

optimization: “One important example concerns the optimization properties of DNNs: It is not known whether stochastic gradient descent (SGD) finds the best approximation ̂ f of a function f of interest.” (Räz and Beisbart, 2022, p. 15)
