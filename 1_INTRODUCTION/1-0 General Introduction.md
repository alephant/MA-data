#### 1-1 DNN as predictive powerhouses

ML models in general and DNN in particular are predictive powerhouses and their predictive power will never be any worse than today. Among many more examples, ML algorithms have achieved human-level accuracy in visual recognition tasks (Russakovsky_2015), disease classification (Esteva_2017), similary judgements (Peterson_2016), high performance on complex tasks (Mnih_2015), natural-sounding audio generation (Oord_2016) or the prediction and modelling of neural activity (Cadena_2018, Yamins_2014, Yamins_2016, Khaligh-Razavi_2014).

However, the use of DNN as scientific models is controversial. DNN are highly complex, state-of-the-art archictectures contain billions of parameters, their functioning is difficult to understand and control for the modeler. Thus, DNN are labelled black boxes. Black boxes somehow do what they are supposed to do, but one does not fully understand how they do. As DNN lack transparency and simplicity, critics dismiss their capacity to enable scientific understanding. At the same time, the use of DNN as scientific models is continously expanding. Especially data-driven sciences such as genomics are transformed by the use of DNN as they are highly capable to learn complex patterns (Eraslan_2019). But worries remain - do scientists sacrifice scientific understanding by ML models compared to traditional scientific models?
“One might argue that a machine-learning approach to determine the non-linear response from varying parameter settings is a rather black-box approach that goes against the traditional approach to spectra: based on scientific understanding and physics.” (Agarwal et al., 2012, p. 1410)
- “astonishing capacity of deep neural networks to facilitate discovery (DeVries et al. 2018) and overcome the complexity of otherwise intractable scientific problems (Senior et al. 2020), as well as to both emulate and outperform experts on routine (Chen et al. 2014), complex, or even humanly impossible (Degrave et al. 2022) tasks. In fact, nearly every empirical discipline has already undergone some form of transformation as a result of developments in and implementation of deep learning and artificial intelligence (Stevens et al. 2020).” (Duede, 2023, p. 1089)
