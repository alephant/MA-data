# Theories of understanding

## Realist thesis regarding understanding

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/47KVST88?page=3783&annotation=F3M2WZFE) “scientific understanding requires that relevant theories are (at least approximately) true, in the sense that their statements or models correspond with (observable and unobservable) reality” ([Regt, 2015, p. 3783](zotero://select/library/items/NF9LB2Q8))

Basic aspects of a realist thesis regarding understanding:
- correspondence theory of truth (in some form)
- theory of truth approximation





truth as crucial condition for understanding

## de Regt

understanding as skill to predict behavior based on theory
[[@deRegt_2015]] rejects realist thesis regarding understanding, ie. understanding requires truth
Rejecting this, de Regt needs another conception of truth

intelligibility of the theory as crucial condition for understanding


## Constructive empiricism, Bas van Fraassen

van Fraassen attempts to kill the "no miracle"-argument of scientific realism

empirical adequacy/success vs truth:
a theory is empirically successful when it successfully predicts and explains observable phenomena
According to van Fraassen, a theory can be empirically successful without being literally true about unobservables; for him, the "no miracle"-argument conflates empirical success with truth; success of science doesn't necessarily imply that our theories are true descriptions of unobservables.

Overextension of Explanation: 
Van Fraassen argues that scientific realists are improperly extending the concept of explanation. While scientists might use explanations to account for particular phenomena based on empirical evidence, the realists are trying to use the same explanatory reasoning to justify the truth of entire scientific theories, including their claims about unobservables. Such an extension, for van Fraassen, is unwarranted.

Historical Counterexamples: 
Van Fraassen points to historical instances where successful theories were later deemed false. For example, the caloric theory of heat was successful in many of its predictions and explanations, but it was later supplanted by the kinetic theory of heat, which denies the existence of caloric. This historical approach suggests that empirical success does not guarantee truth, even in a broad or approximate sense.

Pragmatic Factors: 
He also suggests that there are other reasons, beyond mere truth, that can account for the success of scientific theories. Theories might be adopted because of their simplicity, elegance, or other pragmatic virtues, not necessarily because they're true.
