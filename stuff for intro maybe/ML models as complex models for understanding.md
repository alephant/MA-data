### for what are ML models used for understanding?

==**Models for perception, visual cognition**==
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=2&annotation=J8VASFYW) “deep learning networks are currently regarded as the best models of perceptual similarity judgments in primates (Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016)” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=14&annotation=USIWE5JX) “DCNNs may thus succeed in modeling human perceptual similarity judgments but not yet have the resources to draw a distinction between what something looks like and what it really is.” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK)) adversarial examples could in fact show how DNNs succeed as models for low-level aspects of human perceptual categorization

==**Models for intelligence, causal reasoning, higher cognition**==
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=11&annotation=HIQTXRLX) “I have recently argued that current DCNNs already model a crucially important component of mammalian intelligence—a particular kind of abstraction—that until now eluded our grasp (Buckner, 2018)” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=12&annotation=YJPVNL8T) “Some prominent deep learning researchers have also called for a return to innate biases in deep networks to help them master tasks like causal reasoning or linguistic processing” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

==**Models for learning, knowledge acquisition**==
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=11&annotation=M6FVFDAX) “These claims intersect with conversations from the Golden Age of connectionism, as philosophers appreciated early on that neural networks might provide a proof of concept that certain types of knowledge could be learned directly from sensory experience, without innate knowledge (c.f. Bechtel & Abrahamsen, 2002, pp. 54–57).” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

**==Models for acquisition of categorical knowledge==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=12&annotation=24LI64CB) “DCNNs may also distinctively address some long-standing mysteries in empiricist philosophy of mind regarding the role of abstraction in the acquisition of categorical knowledge, a faculty that has frequently been invoked by empiricists to account for learners' transition from basic sensory associations to the abstract representations deployed in higher cognition but has until recently not been adequately explained (c.f. Buckner, 2018; Laurence & Margolis, 2012).” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

==**Models for innate knowledge**==
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=11&annotation=Z8JD49BI) “neural network research could be rationalist in orientation, in the sense that innate knowledge could be modeled by presetting link weights in a way that biased networks to acquire particular information” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))



### what could possibly vindicate ML models as good models for understanding human cognition?

**==the "new mechanistic movement" vindicating neural networks as mechnistic models for human cognition==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=15&annotation=ZMPSJW9E) “This movement holds (roughly) that explanations in the life sciences work by locating structures and their organization in a target system whose coordinated operations regularly produce the phenomenon of interest.” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK)) 



### Alternatives to ML models as mechanistic models

**==DNNs as computational or mathematical models==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=15&annotation=R7LYZSYQ) “These authors are likely to think that the attempt to force DCNN-based explanations into a mechanistic mold is a mistake, emphasizing instead the computational or mathematical principles which could be implemented in a variety of very different mechanisms.” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))
