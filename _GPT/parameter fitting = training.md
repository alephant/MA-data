Parameter fitting in the context of scientific models refers to the process of adjusting model parameters so that the model accurately represents observed data. This is a crucial step in both traditional scientific modeling and machine learning (ML) models, albeit with some differences in approach and application.

### Traditional Scientific Models

In traditional scientific models, which often arise in fields like physics, chemistry, and biology, parameter fitting usually involves adjusting a finite set of parameters within theoretical or empirical equations to match experimental or observational data. The goal is to ensure the model can predict future observations or explain the underlying mechanisms of the observed phenomena. Techniques such as least squares fitting, maximum likelihood estimation, and others are commonly used. The parameters might represent physical constants, reaction rates, or other phenomena-specific quantities.

### Machine Learning Models

In machine learning models, parameter fitting involves adjusting the weights and biases across the network (for neural networks) or other model-specific parameters to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values in the training data. This process is often referred to as training the model. The objective is to build a model that not only fits the training data well but also generalizes to new, unseen data. Optimization algorithms like gradient descent are typically used to iteratively adjust the parameters.

### Key Differences

- **Scale and Nature of Parameters**: Traditional models often have a smaller, well-defined set of parameters with direct physical interpretations, while ML models, especially deep learning models, can have millions of parameters with no direct physical meaning.
- **Objective**: Traditional models aim to uncover underlying physical laws or relationships, guided by theory. ML models often prioritize predictive accuracy and may not provide insight into the underlying mechanisms.
- **Methods of Fitting**: The fitting process in traditional models often relies on established mathematical techniques specific to the problem domain. In ML, generic optimization algorithms are applied across a wide range of problems, focusing on reducing a loss function.

Both approaches, despite their differences, share the common goal of aligning model outputs with real-world data to enhance understanding, prediction, and decision-making across various scientific and engineering domains.
