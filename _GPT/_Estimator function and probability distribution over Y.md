The excerpt you provided discusses the concept of an estimator in the context of machine learning models. In machine learning, an estimator can be thought of as a type of function or algorithm that attempts to infer or estimate the properties of a population, based on a sample from that population. 

Specifically, the text refers to a machine learning (ML) model trained to complete sentences. Here's how it relates to the concept of an estimator function:

1. **Training the Model**: A machine learning model is trained on a dataset, which includes many examples of sentences (or parts of sentences) paired with the correct completions. Each pair \((x_i, y_i)\) consists of an incomplete sentence \(x_i\) and its correct completion \(y_i\).

2. **Learning Distributions**: During training, the model is learning the probability distribution \(P(Y | X)\) which represents the likelihood of each possible completion \(Y\) given an incomplete sentence \(X\). This distribution is not known a priori but is inferred from the training data.

3. **Estimator Function**: The result of the training process is a function \(f\) that can estimate the probability \(P(y_i | x_i)\) for any given sentence \(x_i\) and potential completion \(y_i\). In other words, the function \(f\) acts as an estimator for the random variable \(Y\) (the completion) given \(X\) (the incomplete sentence). 

4. **Conditional Probabilities**: When we talk about the model estimating conditional probabilities, we mean that the model, using the function \(f\), can predict the likelihood of a certain word or phrase \(y_i\) being the correct completion for a given sentence fragment \(x_i\).

5. **Performance and Validation**: The performance of this estimator function \(f\) is then validated using a separate set of data known as test data. This helps to evaluate how well the function can generalize what it learned during training to new, unseen examples.

6. **The Essence of Modeling**: The statement emphasizes that what we have at the end of the ML training process is an estimator for the probability distribution of \(Y\) given \(X\). This estimator is what we use to make predictions on new data, and the test data help us understand how well our model is likely to perform in real-world scenarios.

In summary, the ML model, through its training process, develops a function that can be used to estimate the likelihood of different possible completions for a given sentence fragment. This is crucial for tasks like text prediction, where we want the model to suggest the most probable next word or phrase in a sequence of text.
