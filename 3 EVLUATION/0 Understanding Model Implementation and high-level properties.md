**What are R&B argue is necessary to understand model implementation?**


**Can structural transparency help?**
“to understand how the code as written brings about the result of the program.” (Creel, 2020, p. 13)


**Acc. to Creel structural transparency can be best defined as knowledge of relations between subcomponents** 
“Without such knowledge of the sub-components and their relations, it would be difficult to successfully trace the path between every possible input and its output. Since there are an infinite number of possible inputs, the possibility of predicting the behavior of the system, and especially of identifying the sources of unexpected behavior in the code, requires a model of the system and how it will treat inputs. ==Therefore the more complete form of analysis is the knowledge of relations between the subcomponents, not the sum of the ability to traverse all possible paths.==” (Creel, 2020, p. 17)

Defining input-output paths fails.
This sounds a lot like T&S approach based on intra-model inferences on data representations that let us understand the relationships of features (in the abstraction of T).
