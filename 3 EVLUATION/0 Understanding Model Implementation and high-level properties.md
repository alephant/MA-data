**What are R&B argue is necessary to understand model implementation?**


**Can structural transparency help?**
“to understand how the code as written brings about the result of the program.” (Creel, 2020, p. 13)


**Acc. to Creel structural transparency can be best defined as knowledge of relations between subcomponents** 
“Without such knowledge of the sub-components and their relations, it would be difficult to successfully trace the path between every possible input and its output. Since there are an infinite number of possible inputs, the possibility of predicting the behavior of the system, and especially of identifying the sources of unexpected behavior in the code, requires a model of the system and how it will treat inputs. ==Therefore the more complete form of analysis is the knowledge of relations between the subcomponents, not the sum of the ability to traverse all possible paths.==” (Creel, 2020, p. 17)

Defining input-output paths fails.
Can T&S approach provide knowledge of relations between subcomponents?

T&S approach: intra-model inferences on data representations that let us understand the relationships of features (in the abstraction of T).


**Structural transparency could provide functional transparency**
“This independence conflicts with existing philosophical accounts, according to which possession of one type of transparency necessarily affords another (Humphreys 2004; Lenhard and Winsberg 2010). On Humphreys’ view, possessing structural transparency provides high-level algorithmic, functional transparency.” (Creel, 2020, p. 23) 

Humphrey argues in favor of a correlation between types of transparency.
This implies that methods that provide structural transparency also provide functional transparency.
==Humphrey's account fits the thesis that lack of understanding of DNNs (due to structural opacity) impedes understanding with DNNs (due to functional opacity).==
