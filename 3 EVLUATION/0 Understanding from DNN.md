DNN as guides for discovery and exploration




**Background theories are important for scientific exploration**
“In detail, background theories determine the general structure of mechanisms in biology, or the structure of state spaces in physics, whereas local theories determine only the concrete ingredients to a particular mechanism or the state space for the problem at hand. In exploration, moreover, background theories “direct inquirers to the kinds of properties that could possibly have a [...] role in their local investigations[...]” (Franklin, 2005, p. 891).” (Boge, 2022, p. 69)
