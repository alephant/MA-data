- What is the relevance of the UAT for the relation between understanding of the model and understanding from the model?

**Boge: what a trained DNN is closely related to the UAT**
“This notion of model as some parametrized input–output mapping is closely related to the universal approximation theorem, which in essence says that a DNN “can approximate virtually any function of interest to any desired degree of accuracy, provided sufficiently many hidden units are available” (Hornik et al., 1989). Newer theorems (Poggio et al., 2020) also show that this can be accomplished with gradient descent and in finite times.” (Boge, 2022, p. 45)
