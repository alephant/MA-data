Second, they have argued that the phenomenon of “adversarial examples” (a concept which may not be possible to define except by ostension, for reasons to be elaborated below) demonstrates that what is learned by DCNNs differs substantially from what is learned by humans and animals.” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK)) 

Reasons why DNNs are not a good model for human knowledge acquisition:
1. DCNN need much more data to learn the same info as humans do
2. #adversarialExamples show that DCNN learn something different than humans do


**==DNNs are "too abstract"==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=15&annotation=8B8849WR) “DCNNs, however, are pitched at a high level of abstraction from perceptual cortex, which could lead one to doubt that they succeed at providing mechanistic explanations for even perceptual processing” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

**==Lack of empirical grounding, weak external link of DNN==**

**==Lack of biological plausibility of DNN==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=15&annotation=KVRNL5SF) “there remains significant debate as to whether backpropagation learning is biologically plausible” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))
