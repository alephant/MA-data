### 1. model-based scientific understanding

what is meant by "understanding"?

on what does understanding depend on?

what is a model (in contrast to other theories of the world)?

why are models used for scientific reasoning?

how does model-based understanding work?
- Lawler & Sullivan (2021)
- Khalifa (understanding is approximately true belief)
- De Regt (understanding depends on intelligibility, not truth, and itâ€™s sensitive to context and background knowledge)
- Weisberg, similarity and idealisation

when does a model successfully foster scientific understanding?
- transparency and intelligibility of a model (how M relates to T)
- 

what are characteristics of successful models?


### 2. ML models as complex models used for understanding

[[Biological inspiration of ML models|how are ML models biologically inspired?]]

[[ML models as complex models for understanding|for what are ML models used for understanding?]]

what makes ML models "complex"?

[[ML models unfit|why are ML models no good models for human cognition?]]

what is the problem of opacity in ML models (problem of explainability, interpretability, intelligibility)?

what type of opacity is meant concering ML models?

how is opacity in ML models different of similar to idealization and abstraction in scientific models?
