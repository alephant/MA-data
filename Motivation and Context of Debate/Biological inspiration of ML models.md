**==Key characteristics of DCNN mirror biological functioning==**
- hierarchical feature composition
- implementation of domain-general assumption to adjust for nuisance variance
- reducing computational complexity by exploiting symmetries in feature space

**==hierarchical feature compostion inspired by "division of labour" between simple and complex cells in ventral stream==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=8&annotation=744S96A4) “The division of labor between convolutional and pooling nodes in early DCNNs was inspired by Hubel and Wiesel's (1967) discovery of two different types of neuron in cat visual cortex” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

**==hierarchical image processing inspired by multi-layered processing in visual cortex==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=8&annotation=GMXFUY5Z) “This story was later extended with a variety of imaging methods to suggest a whole layered processing cascade of hierarchical abstraction in primate visual cortex (Goodale & Milner, 1992)” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

**==domain-general assumptions to adjust for nuisance variation possibly in parallel to biological sensory systems as these must adjust for nuisance as well==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=9&annotation=EBIA67K9) “Another interpretation of DCNNs' success holds their characteristic features to implement a set of unrevisable, domain-general assumptions that help networks control for common forms of variation in perceptual input. Consonant with the previous subsection, depth enforces the assumption that complex features are built from simpler ones. Passing the windows of kernels over the whole image at each layer applies the assumption that each feature can be reused many times in the composition of more complex ones and that features can occur anywhere in the image (e.g., as a hexagon may reuse the same angle feature six times in different locations).” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))

**==Reducing computational complexity by exploiting symmetries in feature space appears evolutionary and behaviorally favourable as well==**
[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RXEUYJP?page=10&annotation=7JACGT4R) “Though some may scoff at these “mere efficiency gains,” they would be decisive in evolutionary or behavioral competitions which required making complex decisions under limited time and resources.” ([Buckner, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/E5DLIBYK))
