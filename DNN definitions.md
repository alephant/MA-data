Simple neural networks consist of an input layer and an output layer; when more layers are stacked, the networks are called deep [8,9]. A DNN learns to perform particular tasks through training, during which the strength of connections between units is learned. Subsequently, the trained DNN is used to perform the same task on novel inputs.” ([Cichy and Kaiser, 2019, p. 305](zotero://select/library/items/VUIMSKQE))
