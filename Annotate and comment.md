skim papers first

annotations reveal the structure of the paper/ the argument
do not annotate points that are simply interesting per se

use annotations to fill structure of own paper
- "this annotation is relevant for introducing why opacity is relevant"
- "this annotation is relevant for argueing against intelligibility as the sole criterion relevant for understanding"


comments to annotation should faciliate the filtering and sorting of annotations
commenting annoations should add context of annotation within the structure of the paper without having to scroll through the paper:
- "example to argument A"
- "objection to view B"
- "contradiction to argument A"

comments then help to relate the annotation to own argumentative structure:
- "example to argument A" - "see Sullivan's example" or "own counterexample"
