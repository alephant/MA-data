**Unclear whether Schelling model could be supported by empirical evidence**
“However, in the 1970s it was not clear whether the model could be adequately linked to empirical evidence, and it actually builds on various ==unrealistic assumptions== (e.g. Reutlinger et al., 2018, pp. 1076–1077).” (Boge, 2022, p. 53)

**Empirical evidence for the mechanism identified by Schelling model**
“Finally, today there is some amount of evidence in support of a mechanism relevantly similar to Schelling’s (Card et  al., 2008; Clark, 1991; McCrea, 2009).” (Boge, 2022, p. 53)

**Despite it being r-instrumental (it employs various unrealistic assumptions), Schelling model can provide understanding**
“The point, then, is that, regardless of its many unrealistic assumptions, Schelling’s model does offer a (possible, or potentially actual) explanation of segregation patterns, and so arguably provides understanding.” (Boge, 2022, p. 53)
