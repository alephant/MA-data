DNN Predictive power 
“In this spirit, researchers have shown that DNNs predict human perceptual similarity judgements [10,11] and outperform any other model in accounting for neural activity in primate sensory cortices” (Cichy and Kaiser, 2019, p. 305)

ML models in general and DNN in particular are predictive powerhouses and their predictive power will never be any worse than today. Among many more examples, ML algorithms have achieved human-level accuracy in visual recognition tasks (Russakovsky_2015), disease classification (Esteva_2017), similary judgements (Peterson_2016), high performance on complex tasks (Mnih_2015), natural-sounding audio generation (Oord_2016) or the prediction and modelling of neural activity (Cadena_2018, Yamins_2014, Yamins_2016, Khaligh-Razavi_2014).
